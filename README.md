## Features

### 🎵 Infinite Generative Audio
- **Phasing Loops**: Uses prime number intervals (7, 11, 13 beats) to create non-repeating, ever-evolving soundscapes
- **Low Cognitive Load**: Pure sine waves with heavy low-pass filtering to remove distracting frequencies
- **Focus-Optimized**: C Minor Pentatonic scale and ambient chord progressions designed for deep work

- **Click to Toggle**: Single click starts/stops the timer
- **Spacebar Control**: Press space to quickly start/stop
- **Glitch Confirmation**: Subtle visual feedback when changing time

### 🎨 Neo-Brutalist Design
- **Typographic Wall**: Massive, centered timer display

- **Minimal UI**: "The Corners" navigation topology
